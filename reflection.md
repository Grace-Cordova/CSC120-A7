- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think I did a good job of going about overriding methods. At this point, this assignment is pretty half baked. I had trouble beginning to overload the methods. I'm not entirely sure which methods to overload and how to do it. I know I can overload the constructors but I wasn't sure whether I was overloading the constructor for that specific method or for building. This had been a really busy week for me, hence the extension. I would've really benefitted from getting into office hours before I began the assignment to clear up a few things.
